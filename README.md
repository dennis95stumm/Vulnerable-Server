# Vulnerable Server

> **CAUTION:** Don't use the compiled smart_server.c on a production server or on your own machine. It's recommended to use a virtual machine instead. Using it on a production server or on the own machine brings a risk to the whole operating system, because the existing hole could be exploited and a shellcode could be injected to the system.
